❖ When it is necessary to run th e engine indoors, make sure that  exhaust gas is forced outdoors. 
❖ When working with toxic or flammable materials, make sure that the area you work in is well-ventilated 
and that you follow all off the mate rial manufacturer’s instructions. 
❖ Never use gasoline as a cleaning solvent. 
❖ To avoid getting burned, do not touch the engine, engine oil or exhaust system during or for a while after 
engine operation. 
❖ After servicing fuel, oil, exhaust or brake systems, ch eck all lines and fittings related to the system for 
leaks. 
 
 
❖ If parts replacement is necessary, replace the parts with HYOSUNG Genuine Parts or their equivalent. 
❖ When removing parts that are to be reused, keep them arranged in an orderly manner so that they may be 
reinstalled in the proper order and orientation. 
❖ Be sure to use special tools when instructed. 
❖ Make sure that all parts used in reassembly ar e clean, and also lubricated when specified. 
❖ When use of a certain type of lubricant, bond, or seal ant is specified, be sure to use the specified type. 
❖ When removing the battery, disconnect the negative cable first and then positive cable. When 
reconnecting the battery, connect the positive cable first and then negative cable, and replace the 
terminal cover on the positive terminal. 
❖ When performing service to electrical parts, if the service procedures do not require use of bat- tery 
power, diconnect the negative cable at the battery. 
❖ Tighten cylinder head and case bolts and nuts, beginning with larger diameter and ending with smaller 
diameter, from inside to outside diagon ally, to the specified tightening torque. 
❖ Whenever you remove oil seals, gaskets, packing, O- rings, locking washers, cotter pins, circlips, and 
certain other parts as specified, be sure to replace th em with new ones. Also, before installing these new 
parts, be sure to remove any leftover material from the mating surfaces. 
❖ Never reuse a circlip. When installing a new circlip , take care not to expand the end gap larger than 
required to slip the circlip over the shaft. After installing a circlip, alwa ys ensure that it is completely 
seated in its groove and securely fitted. 
❖ Do not use self-locking nuts a few times over. 
❖ Use a torque wrench to tighten fasteners to the torque values when specified. Wipe off grease or oil if a 
thread is smeared with them. 
❖ After reassembly, check parts for tightness and operation. 
❖ To protect environment, do not unlawfully dispose of used motor oil and other fluids: batteries, and tires.
❖ To protect Earth’s natural resouces, properly dispose of used vehicles and parts.

FUNCTION OF EI SENSOR 
★ ECU (Engine Control Unit, EI Control Unit) 
: ECU decide the fuel injection volume and ignition time  to adjust the fuel injector opening and closing rate 
which is considered the engine speed, intake air pres sure, intake air volume, engine temperature, oxygen 
volume and throttle opening angle, etc. 
★ EI (Electric fuel Injector) 
: EI spray the fuel to intake pipe by ECU’s injection signal. 
Fuel which is needed combustion in the combustion chamber is supplied from the fuel tank. 
★ GP switch (Gear Position Switch) 
: GP switch is used when start / stop and control E CU as the converted electr ical signal of the gear 
position is supplied ECU. 
★ IAP sensor (Intake Air Temperature : IAPS) 
: IAP sensor measure the pressure which is generated from the intake pipe and compare with the provided 
absolute pressure, then analogize the air volume indire ctly and help to work the fuel injector properly. 
★ IAT sensor (Intake Air Temperature Sensor : IATS) 
: IAT sensor perceive the atmospheric temper ature and is located the air cleaner case. 
★ ISC solenoid (Idle Speed Control Solenoid) 
: ISC solenoid is interlocked with the throttl e body, so ECU control the engine idle speed. 
★ O2 sensor (Oxygen Sensor : O 2S) 
: O2 sensor measure the oxygen volume from the exha ust gas and convert the oxygen volume into voltage 
value, then communicate the output voltage to ECU. 
★ Pick-up Coil 
: Pick-up coil perceive the front and rear cylinder’ s engine speed and realtime of piston position. 
★ PV (Purge control Valve)  
: Purge control valve is part of t he evaporative emission c ontrol system. The purge control valve closes to 
prevent the vapor from reaching the engine when it is turned off. When the engine is started and is ready to 
receive the canister’s contents, the purge control valve opens to allow the vapor flow. 
★ RO switch (Roll Over Switch) 
: RO switch is the fuel cut-off system when t he motorcycle is leaned over 60°for upset accident. 
★ TP sensor (Throttle Position Sensor : TPS) 
: TP sensor detect the throttle opening angle and is located the throttle body. 
It decide the fuel injection volume and compensate the ignition time as inform 
idle· acceleration· deceleration condition and throttle full opening etc. to ECU.

MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE  
This section describes the service procedure for 
each section of the periodic maintenance. 
 
VALVE CLEARANCE 
 
N O T E 
Inspect Initial 1,000 km and Every 4,000 km. 
 
 
The clearance specification is for COLD 
state. 
 
The valve clearance specification is different for 
intake and exhause valves.  
Valve clearance adjustment must be checked and 
adjusted, 1) at the time of periodic inspection, 2) when the valve mechanism is serviced, and 3) when the camshaft is disturbed by removing it for servicing.   
● Remove the spark plug. (Refer to page 2-5) 
● Remove the right air cleaner box. 
● Remove the fuel tank. (Refer to page 4-1) 
● Remove the cylinder head cover ① and ②. 
 
   
● Remove the magneto cover plug ③ and the timing 
inspection plug ④. 
  
   
   
  
 
 PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE   2‐6
 
● Rotate  the magneto  rotor to set the front cylinder’s  
piston at TDC (Top Dead Center) of the compression 
stroke.  (Rotate  the rotor until “F” line on the rotor 
is aligned with the center of hole on the 
crankcase.)  
● To inspect  the front cylinder’s  valve clearance,  insert 
the thickness gauge to the clearance between the 
camshaft and the tappet.  
 
Valve clearance (when cold) 
IN. 0.08±0.01  
EX. 0.11±0.01  
 
   Thickness gauge : 09900 -20806  
 
● If the clearance is out of specification, first remove the 
cam chain tensioner, camshaft housing, camshaft.  
To install the tappet shim  at original position, 
record the shim NO. and clearance  
with“A”,“B”,“C”,“D” mark on the cylinder 
head as the illustration. 
 
  
    Select the tappet that agree with tappet 
clearance (vertical line) and shim NO.(horizontal 
line) as refer to the tappet  shim selection  chart.   
Adjust valve timing, install the camshaft housing and the 
tensioner. 
After the crankshaft rotate about 10 times, measure the 
valve clearance. 
If the clearance be not agree, adjust the 
standard clearance as the same manner above.  
    
 
     
 2‐7  PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE  
 
● In case that valve adjustment which there is 
no the tappet shim selection chart, please 
follow instructions of example in the below.  
For example, the intake clearance is 0.4 and the shim 
is 170 (1.70 mm), select 195 (1.95 mm) 
of the shim which 170 (1.70 mm) of the shim add up the excess 
clearance 0.25 mm when 
adjust with the standard 0.15 as the intake 
standard clearance 0.1 -0.2 mm. 
 
 
 
 
❖ Valve clearance should be checked 
when the engine is cold. 
❖ If you don t rotate the crankshaft 
about 10 times before measuring the 
valve clearance, there is no meaning of 
valve clearance. 
  
● Rotate  the magneto  rotor to set the rear 
cylinder’s  piston at TDC (Top Dead Center) of the 
compression stroke.   
(Rotate the rotor 285  counter-clockwise from 
the “F” line, and until the “R” line on the 
rotor is aligned with the center of hole on the 
crankcase.) 
  
 
● Inspect  the rear cylinder’s  valve  clearance  with 
the same manner of the front cylinder.

Replace the brake hoses Every 4 years, 
Replace the brake fluid Every 2 years. 
 
The motorcycle utilizes front and rear disk brakes.  
Properly operating the brake systems are vital to safe riding. Be sure to perform the brake inspection requirements as schedules. 
The brakes should be inspected at periodic inspection 
by your authorized dealer. 
 
 
Failure to properly inspect and maintain 
your motorcycle brake systems can be 
hazardous. 
Improper maintenance of the brakes 
increases your chances of having an 
accident. 
Be sure to inspect the brakes before each 
use of the motorcycle according to the 
INSPEC TION BEFORE  RIDING section. 
Always maintain your brakes according to 
the MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.  
 
 
Operating the motorcycle in harsh 
condition can be hazardous if you do not 
inspect brake wear often. 
Operating in mud, water, sand, or other 
extreme conditions can cause accelerated 
brake wear. This could lead to an accident. 
If you operate your motorcycle under 
these conditions, the brakes must be 
inspected more often than recommended in 
the MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.  
 
  
 
⊙ BRAKE FLUID 
 
Be sure to check the brake fluid level in the master cylinder. If the level was found to be lower than the lower mark holding the motorcycle upright, inspect the brake pad’s wear condition. 
If the brake pad’s wear condition is good, 
replenish with the proper brake fluid that meets Hyosung’s requirements.
 
  
Front Brake Cylinder 
 
 
Rear Brake Cylinder 
 2‐29  PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE  
 
As the brake pads wear, the fluid level will drop to 
compensate for the new position of brake pads. Replenishing the master cylinder to considered normal periodic maintenance. 
 
 
Brake fluid may be harmful if swallowed or if 
it comes in con- tact with skin or eyes. 
Contact your doctor immediately if brake 
fluid is swallowed and induce vomiting. If 
brake fluid gets into the eyes or in contact 
with the skin, flush thoroughly with plenty 
of water. 
 
 
This motorcycle uses glycol-based brake 
fluid. 
Do not use or mix different types of brake 
fluid, otherwise serious damage will result 
in the brake system. 
Use Only DOT4 brake fluid. 
Do not spill any brake fluid on painted or 
plastic surfaces as it will damage the 
surface severely. 
Never use any brake fluid that has been 
stored in a used or unsealed container. 
Never reuse brake fluid left over from the 
last servicing and stored for long period as 
it absorbs moisture from the air.
 
 
Be careful that water or dust does not enter 
the brake fluid reservoir when refilling. 
 
 
Brake fluid, if it leaks, will interfere with safe 
running and immediately discolor painted 
surfaces. Check the brake hoses and hose 
joints for cracks and oil leakage before riding.
  
⊙ BRAKE PADS  
 
Inspect the front and rear brake pads to determine whether or not the friction pads are worn down to the grooved limit line. If a pad is worn to the grooved limit line it must be replaced with a new one by your 
authorized Hyosung dealer or quali fied 
service mechanic.  The rate at which brake pads will wear depends 
on motorcycle usage, riding style and road surface 
condition.  
 
 
 Front Brake Pads 
 
 
 
Rear Brake Pads  
 
 PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE   2‐30
 
 
 
The extend of brake pad wear can be checked by 
observing the grooved limit on the pad. When the 
wear exceeds the grooved limit, replace the pads with new ones. 
 
 
Replace the brake pad as a set, otherwise 
braking performance will be adversely 
affected. 
 
Inspect every day in the following point at 
the brake system. 
① Brake fluid leakage of the front and rear 
brake system. 
② Leak or damage of the brake hose. 
③ Operating of the brake lever and pedal.④ Wear of the front and rear brake pads.
  
The front and rear brake system requires 
the brake hose or the brake fluid to be 
replaced according to periodic inspection 
chart by your authorized Hyosung dealer 
for safety as they operate at high pressure.
 
 
Riding with worn brake pads will reduce 
braking performance and will increase 
your chance of having accident. Inspect 
brake pad wear before each use. Ask your 
Hyosung dealer or qualified mechanic to 
replace brake pads if any pad is worn to the 
limit. 
 
 
If brake pads are allowed to wear down to 
the metal substrate, metal-to-metal contact 
with the brake disk would lead to noise and 
the brake caliper sparking ; this would 
result in loss of braking and brake disk 
damage, causing a dangerous riding 
condition. 
 
 
Replacing only one of the two brake pads 
can be hazardous. 
Replacing only one brake pads can result 
in uneven braking action. 
Replace both pads together. 
 
 
After replaced the front or rear brake 
pads, squeeze / depress and release 
several times the brake lever/ pedal so 
that it is setting at the original place. 
Then, check that the brakes are operating 
correctly.

cushion to absorb a large proportion of the pressure developed by the master cylinder and thus interferes with the full braking performance of the brake caliper. The presence of air is indicated by“sponginess”of the brake lever and also by lack of braking force. Considering the danger to which such trapped air exposes the machine and rider, it is essential that, after remounting the brake and restoring the brake system to the normal condition, the brake fluid circuit be purged of air in the following manner :   
● Fill the master cylider re servoir to top of the 
inspec tion window. Replace the reservoir cap to 
prevent dirt from entering it.  
● Attach a hose to the air bleeder valve, and insert 
the free end of the hose into a receptacle. 
 
   
 
 
● Bleed air from the brake system. 
● Squeeze and release the brake lever several 
times in rapid succession and sqeeze the lever 
fully without releasing i t. Loosen the bleeder valve 
by turning it a quarter of a tu rn so that the brake fluid 
runs into the receptacle, this will remove the tension of the brake 
lever causing it to touch the handlebar 
grip. Then,  close the air bleeder valve, pump and 
squeeze the brake lever, and open the valve. Repeat 
this process until the fluid flowing into the receptacle no longer 
contains air bubbles.

N O T E 
While bleeding the brake system, replenish the 
brake fluid in the reservoir as necessary. Make 
sure that there is always some fluid visible in 
the reservoir.  
 
  
● Close the air bleeder valve, and disconnect the 
hose. Fill the reservoir with brake fluid to the upper line.
 
    Front brake caliper air bleeder valve  
: 6~9 N·m (0.6~0.9  kg·m) 
 
 
Handle brake fluid with care : the fluid 
reacts chemically with paint, plastics, rubber 
materials, etc.

STEERING 
 
 
N O T E 
Inspect Initial 1,000 km and Every 4,000 km.
  Steering should be adjusted properly for smooth 
turning of handlebars and safe running. Overtight steering pre- vents smooth turning of the handlebars 
and too loose steering will cause poor stability. Check that there is no play in th steering stem while grasping the lower fork tubes by supporting the machine so that the front wheel is off the ground, with the wheel straight ahead, and pull forward. If play is found, perform steering bearing adjustment as described in page 6-30 of this manual. 
  
 
FRONT FORK 
 
 
N O T E 
Inspect Every 4,000 km. 
  Inspect the front forks for oil leakage, scoring or 
scratches on the outer surf ace of the inner tubes. 
Replace any defective parts, if necessary.

TIRE  
 
N O T E 
Inspect Initial 1,000 km and Every 4,000 km.
 
Inspect the tire pressure and the tire thread 
depth periodically. Inspect frequently the tire pressure for the safety and the tire life. 
 
 
Failure to follow these warnings may result 
in an accident due to tire failure. The tires 
on your motorcycle form the crucial link 
between your motorcycle and the road. 
Follow these instructions ; 
● Check tire c ondition and pressure, 
and adjust pressure  before each ride. 
● Avoid overloading your motor cycle. 
● Replace a tire when worn to the 
specified limit, or if you find damage 
such as cuts or cracks. 
Always use the size and type of tires 
specified in this owner’s manual.  
 
  
 TIRE TREAD CONDITION 
 Operating the motorcycle with excessively worn tires 
will decrease riding stability and can lead to loss of control. 
 
● Inspect storage of tire thread s depth by the tire 
wear indicator 
● Replace the front and rear tires at once when 
appear the tire wear indicator. 
  
                             
 2‐39  PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE   
 
 
 
The standard tire on GV125S  is 120/80-16 or 
front and 150/80-15 for rear. 
The use of tires other than those specified 
may cause instability. It is  highly recommended 
to use a HYOSUNG Genuine Tire. 
 
 TIRE PRESSURE 
Insufficient air pressure in the tires not only 
hasten tire wear but also seriously affects the stability of the motorcycle. Under-inflated tires make smooth cornering difficult and over-inflated tires decrease the amount of tire in contact with the ground which can lead to skids and loss of control. Be sure that the tire pressure is within the specified limits at all times. Tire pressure should only be adjusted when the tire is cold. 
If you see the problem with the tire, adjust the 
pressure with the pressure gauge. 
 
If the tire pressure is too high or too low, steering 
will be adversely  affected and tire wear increased.  
Therefore,  maintain the correct tire pressure for 
good roadability  or shorter tire life will result. Cold 
inflation tire pressure is as follows.

COMPRESSION PRESSURE 
 The compression of a cylinder is a good indicator of its 
internal condition. 
 The decision to overhaul the cylinder is often based 
on the results of a compression test. Periodic maintenance records kept at your dealership should include compression reading for each maintenance service. 
 
Compression pressure 
Standard 14~16 kg/cm2 (at 600 rpm)
Service limit 12 kg/cm2 (at 600 rpm)
 
Low compression pressure can indicate any of the 
following conditions : 
  
● Excessively worn cylinder wall 
● Worn-down piston or piston rings 
● Piston rings stuck in grooves 
● Poor seating of valves 
● Ruptured or otherwise defective cylinder head 
gasket 
 
 2‐41  PERIODIC  MAINTENANCE   
 
 
◉ COMPRESSION TEST PROCEDURE 
 
 
N O T E 
Before testing the e ngine for compression 
pres- sure, make sure that the cylinder head 
bolts are tightened to the specified torque 
values and valves are properly adjusted. 
Have the engine warmed up by idling before 
testing. 
Be sure that the battery used is in 
fully-charged condition. 
 
 
Remove the parts concerned and test the compression 
pressure in the following manner. 
 
● Loosen the water cooler mounting bolts from the 
frame. 
● Remove all the spark plug. 
● Fit the compression gauge in one of the plug 
holes,  while taking care that the connection is 
tight.  
● Keep the throttle grip in full-open position. 
● Crank the engine a few seconds with the starter, 
and record the maximum gauge reading as the 
compression of that cylinder.

good indication of the condition of the moving parts. 
 
Oil pressure Standard 
1.4 ± 0.2 kg/cm2
 
(at 60 ℃·4,000 rpm) 
 
If the oil pressure is lower or higher than the 
specification, the following causes may be considered. 
 
◉ LOW OIL PRESSURE 
● Oil leakage from the oil passage 
● Damaged O-ring 
● Defective oil pump 
● Combination of above items 
 
◉ HIGH OIL PRESSURE 
● Engine oil viscosity is too high 
● Clogged oil passage 
● Combination of the above items

● Engine assembly Considerations:  
●  Reverse operation in the above order;  
● The disassembled engine must be cleaned 
clean;  
●  When the left and right box is merged, 
apply the sealant evenly and the fixing bolt diagonally according to the torque 
requirement to lock;  
● When installing the piston, apply lubricating 
oil; 
● The mounting cylinder head must be 
aligned with the timing mark, the 
requirement corresponds to the magnetic motor mark, the fixed bolt diagonally 
according to the torque requirements 
locking, the valve clearance must be within the specified value;  
● Clutch large hub, magnetic motor rotor, 
small sprocket according to the torque requirements of the lock;  
● Engine using oil model SAE10W-40,  
oil volume 1450ml;  
● Water tank filling antifreeze 0.1L, required 
between the upper and lower scales;  
●  0.9L of antifreeze in radiator.

Check the valve stem for abnormal wear or bend. 
Place the valve on V-blocks and measure runout. 
If the service limit is exceeded or abnormal 
condition exists, replace the valve.

 CAMSHAFT  
The camshaft should be checked for runout and also 
for wear of cams and jour nals if the engine has been 
noted to produce abnormal noise or vibration or a lack of out- put power. Any of these abnormality could be caused by a worn camshaft. 
 
■ CAMSHAFT WEAR  
Worn-down cams are often the cause of mistimed  
valve operation resulting in reduced output power. 
The limit of cam wear is specified for both intake and 
exhaust cams in terms of cam height   H, which is to be 
measured with a micrometer.  
Replace camshafts if found it worn down to the 
limit.

  Valve rocker arm  
 If the engine produces abnormal noise or 
vibration or the output power decreases, the valve rocker arm should be checked, and any of these anomalies may be caused by the worn valve rocker arm.

 Tappet & shim wear  
When measuring the valve clearance, the clearance 
should be within the standard range. 
  
Valve clearance Standard(When cold)
Intake valve 0.1~0.2mm 
Exhaust valve 0.2~0.3mm 
  
 
  
    
  
● Inspect the tappet for wear and scratch.   
If modification or scratch is present, replace the tap pet. 
 
● The shim has various size.  
Replace the thin shim to valve clearance is narrow, or 
the thick shim to valve clearance is wide as that 
shim thickness was installed with standard at present.  
 
 
 
 
      
■ SHIM KIND  
There are 41 kinds of shim which thickness is increased  
by each 0.025 mm from 1.20 mm to 2.20 mm.

 4-1 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS  
 
PRECAUTIONS IN SERVICING 
When handling the component parts or servicing the 
EI system, observe the following points for the safety of the system. 
⊙ELECTRICAL PARTS  
▣ CONNECTOR / COUPLER  
● When connecting a connector, be sure to push it in 
until a click is felt. 
● With a lock type coupler, be sure to release the 
lock when disconnecting, and push it in fully till the works when connecting it. 
● When disconnecting the coupler, be sure to hold the 
coupler body and do not pull the lead wires. 
● Inspect each terminal on the connector / coupler 
for looseness or bending. 
● Inspect each terminal for corrosion and 
contamination. 
 
The terminals must be clean and free of any 
foreign material which could impede proper terminal contact. 
 
 
 
● Inspect each lead wire circuit for poor connection by 
shaking it by hand lightly. If any abnormal 
condition is found, repair or replace. 
 
        
 
● When taking measurements  at electrical connectors 
using a tester probe, be sure to insert 
the probe from the wire harness side (backside) of the 
connector / coupler. 
 
 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS 4-2  
 
● When connecting meter probe from the terminal side 
of the coupler (connection from harness side not being 
possible), use extra care not to force and cause the male terminal to bend or the female terminal to open. 
Connect the probe as shown to avoid opening of female terminal. Never push in the probe where male terminal is 
supposed to fit. 
● Check the male connector for bend and female  
connector for excessive op ening. Also check the 
coupler for locking (looseness), corrosion, dust, etc. 
 
⊙ FUSE  
● When a fuse blows, always investigate the cause 
to correct it and then replace the fuse.  
● Do not use a fuse of a different capacity. 
● Do not use wire or any other substitute for the 
fuse.   
 
 
⊙ ECU / VARIOUS SENSORS  
● Since each component is a high-precision part, 
great care should be taken not to apply any sharp 
impacts during removal and installation. 
 
 
  
 
   
● Be careful not to touch the electrical terminals of the 
ECU. 
The static electricity from your body may damage 
this part. 
 
 4-3 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS  
 
● When disconnecting and connecting the ECU, 
make sure to turn “OFF” the ignition switch, or 
electronic parts may get damaged. 
 
  
 
     
 
● Battery connection in reverse polarity is strictly 
prohibited. 
Such a wrong connection will damage the 
components of the EI system instantly when reverse power is applied. 
 
  
 
   
 
● Removing any battery terminal of a running 
engine is strictly prohibited. 
The moment such removal is made, damaging 
counter electromotive forc e will be applied to the 
ECU which may result in serious damage. 
 
    
 
 
 
● Before measuring voltage at each terminal, check to 
make sure that battery voltage is 11 V or higher. 
Terminal voltage check at low battery voltage will 
lead to erroneous diagnosis. 
INCORRECT
 
 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS 4-4  
 
● Never connect an ohmmeter to the ECU with its 
coupler connected. If attempted, damage to ECU 
or sensors may result. 
● Be sure to use a specified voltmeter / ohmmeter. 
Otherwise, accurate measurements may not be 
obtained and personal injury may result. 
 
⊙ USING TESTERS  
● Use well-charged batteries in the tester. 
● Be sure to set the tester to the correct testing 
range. 
 
▣ USING THE TESTER 
● Incorrectly connecting the  and  probes may 
cause the inside of the tester to burnout. 
● If the voltage and current are not known, make 
measurements using the highest range. 
● After using the tester, turn the power off.

 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS 4-6  
 
⊙ INJECTION TIME (INJECTION VOLUME)  
The factors to determine the injection time include the bas ic fuel injection time, which is calculated on the basis 
of intake air pressure, engine speed and throttle opening angle, and various compensations. 
These compensations are determined according to the si gnals from various sensors that detect the engine and 
driving conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 4-7 EI SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS  
 
⊙ COMPENSATION OF INJECTION TIME (VOLUME)  
The following different signals are output from the respecti ve sensors for compensation of the fuel injection time 
(volume).  
 
SIGNAL DESCRIPTION 
WATER COOLANT TEMPERATURE 
SENSOR SIGNAL  When engine temperature is low, injection time (volume) is 
increased. 
INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR 
SIGNAL When intake air temperature is low, injection time (volume) is 
increased. 
 
 
BATTERY VOLTAGE SIGNAL ECU operates on the battery voltage and at the same time, it 
monitors the voltage signal for compensation of the fuel injection time (volume). A longer injection time is needed to adjust injection volume in the case of low voltage. 
ENGINE RPM SIGNAL At high speed, the in jection time (volum e) is increased. 
 
STARTING SIGNAL When starting engine, additional fuel is injected during 
cranking engine. 
 
ACCELERATION SIGNAL / 
DECELERATION SIGNAL  During acceleration, the fuel injection time (volume) is 
increased in accordance with the throttle opening speed and 
engine rpm. During deceleration, the fuel injection time (volume) is decreased. 
 
 
⊙ INJECTION STOP CONTROL  
SIGNAL DESCRIPTION 
 
ROLL OVER SWITCH SIGNAL 
(FUEL CUT-OFF) When the motorcycle rolls over, the roll over switch sends a 
signal to the ECU. Then, this signal cuts OFF current supplied to the fuel pump, fuel injector and ignition coil. 
 
OVER-REV. LIMITER SIGNAL The fuel injectors stop operation when engine rpm reaches rev. 
limit rpm.

The starter system consists of the following components : the starter motor, starter relay, clutch lever switch, 
side stand switch, GP switch, starter switch, engine stop switch, ignition switch and battery. 
Pressing the starter switch (on the right handlebar swit ch) energizes the starter relay, causing the contact 
points to close, thus completing the circui t from the starter motor to the battery. 
 
 
  
 
     
 
  
SIDE STAND / IGNITION  INTERLOCK  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  
This side stand / ignition interlock sy stem prevents the motorcycle from being started with side stand down. 
The system is operated by an electric circuit provided between the battery and ignition coil.  
The circuit consists of the neutral indicator light and switches. 
The ignition coils will send voltage to the spark plug s depending on what gear the transmission is in and 
whether the side stand is either up or down. 
The gear position and side stand switches work together in this system. The ignition coil work only in two 
situations as follows.
